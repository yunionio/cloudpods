//The CURRENCY type specifies currency information. It is represented as an 8-byte integer, scaled by 10,000, to give a fixed-point number with 15 digits to the left of the decimal point, and four digits to the right. This representation provides a range of 922337203685477.5807 to â€“922337203685477.5808. For example, $5.25 is stored as the value 52500.
