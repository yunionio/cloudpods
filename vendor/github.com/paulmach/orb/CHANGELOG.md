No changes

The v0.7.0 tag was updated since it initially pointed to the wrong commit. This is causing caching issues.

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/paulmach/orb/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) - 2022-05-10

This tag is broken, please use v0.7.1 instead.

### Breaking Changes

-   tilecover now returns an error (vs. panicing) on non-closed 2d geometry by [@paulmach](https://github.com/paulmach) in https://github.com/paulmach/orb/pull/87

    This changes the signature of many of the methods in the [maptile/tilecover](https://github.com/paulmach/orb/tree/master/maptile/tilecover) package.
    To emulate the old behavior replace:

        tiles := tilecover.Geometry(poly, zoom)

    with

        tiles, err := tilecover.Geometry(poly, zoom)
        if err != nil {
        	panic(err)
        }

## v0.2.0 - 2021-01-16

### Breaking Changes

-   Foreign Members in Feature Collections

    Extra attributes in a feature collection object will now be put into `featureCollection.ExtraMembers`.
    Similarly, stuff in `ExtraMembers will be marshalled into the feature collection base.
    The break happens if you were decoding these foreign members using something like

    ```go
    type MyFeatureCollection struct {
        geojson.FeatureCollection
        Title string `json:"title"`
    }
    ```

    **The above will no longer work** in this release and it never supported marshalling. See https://github.com/paulmach/orb/pull/56 for more details.

-   Features with nil/missing geometry will no longer return an errors

    Previously missing or invalid geometry in a feature collection would return a `ErrInvalidGeometry` error.
    However missing geometry is compliant with [section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) of the spec.
    See https://github.com/paulmach/orb/issues/38 and https://github.com/paulmach/orb/pull/58 for more details.

### Changed

-   encoding/mvt: faster unmarshalling for Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) see https://github.com/paulmach/orb/pull/57
