## What is Cloudpods?

<img src="https://v1.cloudpods.org/images/cloudpods_logo_green.png" alt="Cloudpods" height="100">

Cloudpods is a cloud-native open source unified multi/hybrid-cloud platform developed with Golang, i.e. Cloudpods is *a cloud on clouds*. Cloudpods is able to manage not only on-premise KVM/baremetals, but also resources from many cloud accounts across many cloud providers. It hides the differences of underlying cloud providers and exposes one set of APIs that allow programatically interacting with these many clouds.

## Who needs Cloudpods?

* Those who need a simple solution to virtualize a few physical servers into a private cloud
* Those who need a compact and fully automatic baremetal lift-cycle management solution
* Those who want to turn a VMware vSphere virtualization cluster into a private cloud
* Those who need a cohesive view of both public and private cloud in a hybrid cloud setup
* Those who need a centric portal to access multiple acccounts from multiple public clouds
* Those who is currently using a single cloud account, but will not lose the possibility to adopt multicloud strategy
